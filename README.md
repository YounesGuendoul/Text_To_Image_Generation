# Text_To_Image_Generation
Bulding an application that generate Image from Text using Stable Diffusion and Tkinter.

## installation
First you should install **cuda** in this website : https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=11&target_type=exe_network

then you should install **pytorch** by using this website : https://pytorch.org/ or use this command **pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118**
for me i used cuda 11.8 

you can also use the CPU instead the GPU but the problem it's gonna take a long time to execute
